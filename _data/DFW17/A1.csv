"Andrea Berns","Cynical Man Explains to His Son the Ways of the
World","Inspired by a short scene in Wallace’s Infinite Jest, this flash
fiction piece is written in the form of a monologue between a crudely blunt
father and his young son that takes place in a Dairy Queen. In a voice
reminiscent of the Incandenzas, the cynical father gives his four-year-old son
insight about college, marriage, and life as a middle-aged washout."
"James McAdams","Dreamcatchers","In this story, “Dreamcatchers,” a lonely,
dying man's final days are redeemed by the influence of a troubled young woman
he meets at a strip club (Yes, I know this sounds cliched!). As a hears her
story, he loses interest in romantic relations with her, instead sympathizing
with her addicted plight and doing the best to save her. Even though he fails
at this task, this action of “silent heroism” (The Pale King) transforms his
final days."
