title: "“We’ve been inside what we wanted all along”: Immanence and David Foster Wallace"
abstract: "Among contemporary fiction writers, few answer as readily as David Foster Wallace to the name of philosopher of immanence. In This is Water, Wallace essentially summarizes the problem of immanence – the problem of life in an immersive, invisible medium – with a joke: “There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, ‘Morning, boys. How’s the water?’” One young fish, in the only element he has ever known, asks his companion, “What the hell is water?” Throughout the speech, Wallace tries to get Kenyon graduates to see that the “water” they swim through is comprised of a series of “default settings,” assumptions – most of them solipsistic – that are so naturalized as to go unnoticed, those “most obvious, ubiquitous, important realities” that prove “the hardest to see and talk about” because we live wholly inside them. In trying to illuminate such realities, Wallace’s fictions eschew the predictable dramatic arcs and signs of too-tidy enlightenment he associated with conventional realism. He forges in the stead of such effects an existentialist project that takes aim at immanence – at the ubiquitous and the enveloping – through plotless stasis, recursive self-examination, and overwhelmingly informative encyclopedism. The infinite may be one of his major subjects, but he works always with a wariness of the transcendence of lived reality and immanence it portends. Freedom and other states of liberation in Wallace depend on going (back) in, not out or away into a realm of detachment – no “pathetic” “flight-from,” in the words of Hal Incandenza, no getting away from it all. In all these ways Wallace seems to agree with a well-known maxim paraphrasing a line of Robert Frost’s poetry: the only way out is through.<br /><br />
In this talk I explore Wallace’s immanence project through his dogged work on the language of away, out, in, and exit and his primary means for doing that work: the creation of strange, often rhizomatic forms of architecture, centered on images of paradoxical doors and other portals that I suggest are inspired by his deep reading of Kafka, the fiction writer Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari champion as the great portrayer of immanence. In its readings my talk focuses on images of the unboundable self in Infinite Jest, Oblivion (especially “The Suffering Channel”), and The Pale King, while also taking in elements of The Broom of the System, Wallace’s understanding of Wittgenstein, and a few other texts and examples."
