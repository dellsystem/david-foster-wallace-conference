<p>
David Foster Wallace is one of the most highly regarded novelists of
contemporary literature. His novel <em>Infinite Jest</em> is regarded as one of
the most important works in contemporary literature. It’s worth noting that
this masterpiece was a product of the truly prodigious output of one of
America’s finest authors. Through his novels, his short stories, and his
nonfiction essays, Wallace has provided us an enduring reflection of our
society. Through his teaching, he demanded a rigorous and heartfelt approach to
writing, pushing his students to use language to express the inexpressible. He
could be as unforgiving as he was hilarious, as dark as he was endearing.
</p>

<p>
It is clear from interviews and conversations with those who knew him that
Wallace himself was uncomfortable with the attention that fame brought him.
There is an acknowledged irony to hosting a three-day conference dedicated to
his memory.  We might imagine that he would have climbed the nearest hill to
avoid us, preferring the blue sky isolation of the single lonely hill in
Normal, Illinois, to the coffee-flavored halitosis of his most ardent fans.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, I find it more likely that he would have attended the
conference – his face conveniently obscured under a rather life-like
form-fitting polybutylene-resin mask<sup><a href="#footnote">[1]</a></sup> – in
order to write about us.  He would have described our efforts and our foibles
as we seek – ever imperfectly – to better understand what it means to write and
to exist.
</p>

<p>
The DFW conference remains dedicated to Wallace’s memory and his legacy, and we
are very thankful for everyone who has supported our efforts.  Please enjoy the
conference, and let us know of any suggestions for how we can make it better by
email: <a href="mailto:dfwconference@gmail.com">dfwconference@gmail.com</a>.

Sincerely,<br />
