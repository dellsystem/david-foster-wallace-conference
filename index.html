                Call for papers
            </h2>
            <p>
                The 2019 call for papers is now live!
            </p>
            <p>
                The conference invites both critical scholarship
                and creative writing.  Papers and panels should
                focus on literary works published since the 1950s
                and/or in the works of David Foster Wallace.
                Creative writing proposals in all genres are
                welcome.

            <p>
                In recognition of differing financial situations, we
                offer different registration tiers. It typically costs
                $70 per person to cover catering, classroom
                reservations, and speaker fees&mdash;the higher fees paid
                by full-time faculty help subsidize student
                attendees.
